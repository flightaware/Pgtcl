Document var substitution to pg_sendquery

Document pg_sendquery_prepared

Set up error code when returning errors from postgres stuff.
Return postgres status like {POSTGRES PGRES_EMPTY_QUERY} or whatever.

Go through all possible C library calls to investigate a Postgres
result and make sure they're supported.

Make a cursor-like thing that sits on top of postgres results.  It's
"reusable", because it knows to close out the previous result when it's
being handed a new result.

Fix up new asynchronous operation stuff to use applicable Tcl internals.

Make a new command that uses the async interface but waits behind your
back through the tcl event loop, something like

    pg_query $conn query resultVar {resultCode}

It iterates the resultCode for each result found, automatically clearing
the result at the end of each iteration.

X add -list and -llist options to return list in pg_result

- add introspection commands? e.g. to return the connection handles, or result handles

Possibly implement a notice processor that will allow us to catch reporting
of notice and warning messages generated by libpq.  These are normally
just dumped to stdout.

DONE Make configure script use or have an option to use "pg_config --includedir"
to find the postgres includes and "pg_config --libdir" to find the postgres
libraries.

DONE Support for asynchronous operation.

DONE Stubify the build.

DONE Make the build TEA-compliant, including

DONE Document pg_execute.

DONE Document pg_on_connection_loss.

DONE Document new asynchronous operation stuff.

DONE Add support for PQsendQueryParams (parameter substitution to asynchronous
queries.)

DONE Add support for PQsendQueryPrepared (parameter substitution to prepared
statements as asynchronous queries.)
