.TH "PG_ESCAPE_STRING" "" "04 March 2019" "" "PostgreSQL Tcl Interface Documentation"

.SH NAME
pg_escape_string \- escapes a string for inclusion into SQL statements. This is the same as pg_quote. It was added for consistency.

.SH SYNOPSIS

.nf
pg_escape_string \fIstring\fR
.fi
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.PP
\fBpg_escape_string\fR quotes a string and escapes single
quotes and backslashes within the string, making it safe for inclusion 
into SQL statements.
.PP
If you're doing something like

.nf
    pg_exec $conn "insert into foo values ('$name');" 
.fi
and name contains text includeng an unescaped single
quote, such as Bob's House, at best the insert will fail, and
at worst your software will be exploited via an SQL injection attack.
Passing value strings through \fBpg_escape_string\fR
will properly quote them for insertion into SQL commands.

.nf
    pg_exec $conn "insert into foo values ([pg_escape_string $name]);" 
.fi
\&...will make sure that any special characters that occur in name, such as
single quote or backslash, will be properly quoted.
.SH "ARGUMENTS"
.TP
\fB\fIstring\fB\fR
The string to be escaped.
.SH "RETURN VALUE"
.PP
Returns the string, escaped for inclusion into SQL queries.  Note that
it adds a set of single quotes around the outside of the string as well.
.SH "SEE ALSO"
.PP
In most cases, with recent versions of SQL, it is better to use the native parameter insertion capabilities
of the SQL server and protocol. If you are using a version of PostgreSQL more recent then 7.4, consider the
optional parameter arguments to pg_exec and pg_sendquery, and the paramarray option to pg_exec, pg_sendquery, and
pg_select.
